# jPaint

The recruiting project: the windows Paint in Java. A result the three days of work. That was around eleven years ago.

Someone take a look at it and decided to hire me. For the long time I thought, they hire everyone who ask for it.

## Notes

* I used the Eclipse IDE
* I used Polish language in comments, I guess due to my lack of the skills at the time
* I didn't implement the flood fill (I couldn't and I haven't much time to learn)
* At the time I didn't know much of git (except simple commands), so the project don't contain the original commits
